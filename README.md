# Berliner Gartenkarte 2017

What you are finding here is the source code repository of Berlin's urban agriculture map. It displays the field of intercultural, community and plentiful other forms of urban gardening initatives. It is live on [`gartenkarte.de`](http://gartenkarte.de).

The software is derived from the [TransforMap Viewer](https://github.com/TransforMap/transformap-viewer/) ([demo](http://viewer.transformap.co/)) and is accompanied by a data transformation strategy, custom icons and integration with other services from the [Transformaps ecosystem](https://discourse.transformap.co/t/introducing-the-transformap-testbed-architecture/1273). This web map displays data from the [TransforMap data service](https://github.com/TransforMap/data.transformap.co) and uses dynamic filters which are curated in a [wiki database](https://base.transformap.co).
